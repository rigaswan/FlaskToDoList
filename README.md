# Flask Web Development
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
My [website](http://rigas.pythonanywhere.com/) was made by Flask in Python.
It requires user to register first and then log in to use the application.
There are **three** services that the user can use.

##1. To-do-list
A list of things to do will be shown.
The user can add a new thing to be done in the textarea.
When the user has done a certain thing, he/she can delete it one by one.

##2. OCR
The user can upload a file for OCR. The file can be a pdf or any image file. The text will be extracted and put inside a textarea. The user can choose to download the text as a txt file.

##3. Next train
The user can check the arrival time of the next four MTR train in HK.
