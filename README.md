# Flask Web Development
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/uVzpz4_r_Vs>
### Description:

Welcome to my Flask-powered website, accessible [here](http://rigas.pythonanywhere.com/). This web application enhances your productivity and convenience through three distinct services, each designed to make your life easier. 
The file [app.py](app.py) is the main python program. It holds the web application. 
You can find all the html files in the [templates](templates/) folder.
The [TDL.db](TDL.db) stores the users' data and the corrsponding to-do-list. Sqlite was used for updating the database.


### 1. To-do List:
Organize your tasks effortlessly with our intuitive to-do list feature. Add new tasks through the user-friendly textarea, and mark them as completed to keep track of your accomplishments. The power to stay organized is now at your fingertips.

### 2. OCR (Optical Character Recognition):
Transform your documents seamlessly by uploading PDFs or image files for OCR. Watch as the magic happensâ€”text is extracted and conveniently displayed in a textarea. You even have the option to download the extracted text as a TXT file, making information extraction a breeze.

### 3. Next Train Information:
Stay on top of your schedule with real-time information on the next four MTR trains arriving in Hong Kong. Our app fetches data from the official Hong Kong MTR API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date arrival times. Never miss your train again!
